# Train_Scheduler
An app for storing train scheduling, designed to practice with firebase and moment.js

This project aims to showcase new learning regarding data storage using Firebase, as well as working with time using the JavaScript library, moment.js. a major roadblock to overcome in this project was figuring out how to display the same values in the same format for trains that had already arrived, and for those that were yet to arrive. To solve this required understanding some mathematical concepts, and how to make moment.js work with these. The result is an app that effectively display what it is meant to, and is easy to interacty with. Take a look here https://nick-haer.github.io/Train_Scheduler/
